# OSINT

## Overview / What is it?
No matter your skill in computer science or cyber security, chances are you’ve done **OSINT** before - whether you realized it or not. Have you ever checked a seller’s profile history and reviews before buying from them online? Looked up a potential dating partners social media? Used Google Street View to see what a hotel really looks like from the outside? 

Looks like you’ve already been doing some OSINT in your everyday life.

It is probably the most beginner-friendly start into cyber security, since you likely already have the base skills. However, don't be fooled - there are many advanced techniques and tools that can bring your skills to the next level.

OSINT is short for **Open Source Intelligence**. As the name suggests, it is about using open source information to gather intelligence. 'Open source' here means publicly available data - social media, blogs, videos, Google Maps, satellite images, and more. 
Because this information is accessible to everyone, anyone can follow the trail and connect the dots. And since it only uses freely available sources, OSINT is legal.

Here are some additional categories connected to OSINT:
- HUMINT - Human Intelligence
- FININT - Financial Intelligence
- GEOINT - Geospatial Intelligence
- IMINT - Imagery Intelligence (Satellite/Aerial)
- MASINT - Measurement and Signature Intelligence
- SIGINT - Signals Intelligence
- TECHINT - Technical Intelligence

## Real World Applications & Relevance
While improving your OSINT skills can help with everyday tasks like dating, shopping, or checking hotels, its potential goes far beyond that.

OSINT can be used by law enforcement to track down criminals, or in wartime to monitor troop movements.
Similarly in the cyber space it can be used to find leaked passwords or detect scam websites. It can also be a step in a [Red Team](red_team.md) operator's - or even criminal's - workflow to find additional intelligence on their target.
As you can imagine, OSINT is an important tool for journalists, as well, helping them uncover stories or verify evidence.
Companies can use OSINT to monitor competitors actions and keep an eye on emerging trends. 
It can even help [find lost ancient cities](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmznzkly3go).

The use cases of OSINT are as diverse as the information you can gather online. It has many beneficial uses, but also some bad uses, such as stalking or criminals learning when you are not at home. So, knowing the possibilities or OSINT, you should be more careful about what information you share openly on the internet!

## Recent News & Trends
[Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) is a reputable OSINT investigator team that regularly publishes results of their investigations. In a [recent post](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/08/08/strongwhat-can-open-sources-reveal-about-beijings-deadly-floods-strong/), they set out to find information about recent floods in China. They tried to verify images found on social media platforms about this flood. They use satellite images, YouTube videos and other open sources. Alongside to geolocation, one of the biggest challenges in recent years has been to distinguish AI-generated, older and unrelated content.

In the Ukraine they have now launched a 'OSINT war crime unit', acknowledging the importance of OSINT on nation state level. ([Source](https://osint-news.com/2025/05/28/ukraines-prosecutors-launch-osint-war-crime-unit/))

Organizations, such as [Trace Labs](https://www.tracelabs.org/) use crowdsourced 'OSINT to help find missing people'. 

## Challenges
To get an understanding of OSINT, we have prepared two challenges for you!

1. **DTU Hacker Lab Creation**
	Now with the creation of DTU Hacker Lab 2.0, it is time to explore the original, now DTUHax. When was it created?
	- What is the earliest version of the 'hackerlab.dtu.dk' website you can find? 
	- What is the earliest date you can find, in connection with the DTU Hacker Lab/DTUHax (Creation Date)?
2. **Das Rätsel der Enigma**
	Du hast [ein Foto von einer Enigma Machine](enigma.dng) gefunden und möchtest sie dir gerne persönlich anschauen.
	- Aber wo befindet sich diese Enigma (Addresse und Koordinaten)?
	- Mit welchem Gerät wurde das Foto aufgenommen?
	- Wann wurde diese Enigma angeschaft?

*(Any questions/issues with the challenges? Come to a meeting/event, write in Discord and ask us!)*
