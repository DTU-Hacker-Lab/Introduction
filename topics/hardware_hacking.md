# Hardware Hacking

## Overview / What is it?
The cyberspace and physical space have become increasingly connected in the recent years. This connection, of course, is relevant for cyber security. 
Hardware Hacking is the bridge between physical security and cyber security. 

Hardware hacking is about understanding, modifying and securing hardware, firmware and signals. Electronical knowledge can be of help in this field. This can be physical devices such as laptops, routers, USB sticks, door locks and more, or signals such as WiFi, Bluetooth, RFID, NFC, ...

Physical Security is the more traditional security, such as guards, locks or cameras, all of which can be hacked or manipulated. This is also closely related to Social Engineering (also called Human Hacking) and [Reverse Engineering](reversing.md) for low level and signal logic.

## Real World Applications & Relevance
Without realizing, many aspects of physical security have transitioned to digital solutions. From game console hacking to phone number hijacking. Locks can be picked, smart locks and access cards can be cloned or jammed granting unauthorized access. Physical money has been replaced by cards containing data that can be stolen through physical devices or human manipulation, resulting in financial theft. [Heart rate monitors](https://www.cdu.edu.au/news/health-monitoring-devices-risk-being-hacked-study-shows) or [pacemakers](https://www.science.org/content/article/could-wireless-pacemaker-let-hackers-take-control-your-heart) can be manipulated or turned off, which could lead to loss of lifes.

## Recent News & Trends
You are probably all aware of the AirTag - a tracker created by Apple to track your belonging. It has also been used to stalk people. Hardware hacking has reportedly been used to disable or [remove the speaker](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/airtag-hacks/) so that it will no longer indicate it's position through sound.  

It is no longer necessary for a thief to steal your car keys or break the window, instead wireless signals are now used to unlock the car. ([Source](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/06/19/keyless-car-theft-research/))

## Challenges
Giving beginner friendly hardware challenges is difficult, since a lot require specific tools.

First let's give you challenges where no additional tools are needed:
1. Do basic 'Wardriving' with your phone ([Wigle](https://wigle.net/))
2. Similarly use an app such as [Network Survey](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.craxiom.networksurvey/) to gather cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth data in your area.
**Which Wi-Fi signals are near your house? Can you use only the Wi-Fi signals around you to figure out your location?**

If you are willing to pay a little money you could experiment with:
- Raspberry Pis
- ESPs
- SDR-RTL
- Digispark Attiny85 programmable USBs
- ...
