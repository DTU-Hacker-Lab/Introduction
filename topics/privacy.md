# Privacy + Censorship

## Overview / What is it?
Think about sending a letter to a friend. You seal it in an envelope so that only they can read it — that’s privacy. Now imagine if the post office opened your letter first and decided whether it is allowed to be delivered — that’s censorship.

Privacy is about your right to keep your personal life, information, and relationships to yourself. It is also about choosing when, how and with whom they are shared.
Censorship, on the other hand, is when someone (like a government, company, or even a social media platform) is controlling or limiting the information and ideas you can access or express.

## Real World Applications & Relevance
Why should you care? Because privacy protects your ability to be yourself without fear of judgment. Your ability to access information and ideas, as well as speak about those when you want to, shapes what you and others know. It is the freedom of choice and to be yourself.

Privacy and censorship don’t always show up as big dramatic events. Sometimes they creep into everyday life in small, almost invisible ways.
- Personalization/Targeted Ads: Streaming services or search engines remember what you like and recommend more of it. That can be convenient, but it also means they track your interests often without explicit consent and potentially sell it to third parties. They can also implicitly reveal very private and sensitive information, such as your sexual orientation. (See: [Gaydar: Facebook friendships expose sexual orientation](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2611/2302) as an example)
- Opinion Bubbles: Algorithms on social media often show you posts similar to what you’ve liked before. Over time, this creates a rabbit hole called a _filter bubble_. This can lead to isolation and a very narrow view of the world and opinions online. (See Netflix documentary: The Social Dilemma)
 - Content Restrictions: Some platforms quietly remove or hide posts they consider “inappropriate,” sometimes for good reasons (spam, harmful content), sometimes not. In certain countries, entire topics or news stories are blocked.
- Government Surveillance & Internet Shutdowns: In more extreme cases, authorities monitor private communications, block websites, or shut down internet access entirely, often during protests or elections. The most noteworthy example is probably the [The Great Firewall of China](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/internet-fragmentation/the-chinese-firewall/)

While some of these things might seem harmless or even helpful, they can slowly reduce the variety of voices and ideas you’re exposed to, which could lead to your bubble becoming a cage.

## Recent News & Trends
The UK has recently introduced a new rule that requires age checks to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.  This can be a very sensible decision at first glance. However, a lot of people are worried, because it means everybody needs to share personal information online, which can lead to misuse of this information by the platforms and a loss of anonymity online. It is a loss of privacy that can lead to risk of censorship for everybody. ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/12/why-the-uk-age-verification-law-has-led-to-backlash.html))

On the other side, there are organizations such as 'Reporters without Borders' that fight censorship in creative ways such as creating ['The Uncensored Library'](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/uncensored-library), a digital library build in the video game Minecraft, which is generally accessible worldwide.

## Challenges
Privacy:
1. Visit different websites and observe the network traffic to see what information is sent where.
2. Do you use Google or Facebook? See what permissions you give them in terms of data collections. Can you request the data they collected from you?

Censorship:
3. While in the university network, try visiting the Tor Project website. Can you visit it? If not, what can you do to access it?
4. Install [Tails](https://tails.net/) on an empty USB stick and use the Tor Browser to visit the onion website of The New York Times.
