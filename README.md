# Introduction

## DTU Hacker Lab
Welcome to the DTU Hacker Lab GitHub! We are a student club at DTU about cyber security.
We will organise talks, discussions, workshops and more about the latest security news, research papers and hands-on security challenges.
We seek to explore whatever topic inside of cyber security interests us. The next section gives an introduction to the main areas.

**If you are a student at DTU, feel free to join any event advertised through Posters at DTU, Linkedin or our Discord! Or just come to the Hacker Lab Building 322 Room 233.**
